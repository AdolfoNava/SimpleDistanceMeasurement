# SimpleDistanceMeasurement
This is a c++ app to find the distance between a point on a grid and the shape's coordinates all done in the main.cpp file without utilizing vectors and only simple variables.

This is a straight-forward implementation that also uses as little c++ libraries as possible.

There are comments throughout the main.cpp file to indicate the reasoning and function of all the methods, variables and calls.
